# Use Terraform to manage OSS {#concept_nqx_wps_zfb .concept}

This topic describes how to install and configure Terraform and how to use Terraform to manage OSS.

## Install and configure Terraform {#section_twh_cqs_zfb .section}

Before using Terraform, follow these steps to install and configure Terraform:

1.  Download the installation package applicable to your operating system from [Terraform official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). In this topic, Terraform is installed and configured in Linux as an example.
2.  Extract the installation package to the following path: /usr/local/bin. If you extract the executable file to another path, you must add the path to global variables.
3.  Run the path verification command. If a list of available Terraform options is displayed, Terraform is installed successfully.

    ```
    [root@test bin]#terraform
    Usage: terraform [-version] [-help] <command> [args]
    ```

4.  Create and authorize a RAM user.

    1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/#/overview).
    2.  Create a RAM user named Terraform and create an AccessKey for the user. For more information, see [Create a RAM user](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/28637.html#concept-gpm-ccf-xdb).
    3.  Authorize the RAM user. You can add relevant permissions to the Terraform RAM user as needed. For detailed steps, see [Authorize RAM users](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/28639.html#concept-t13-3gf-xdb).
    **Note:** To maintain data security, do not use the AccessKey of your Alibaba Cloud account to configure Terraform.

5.  You must create a separate directory for each Terraform project. Therefore, create a test directory first: terraform-test.

    ```
    [root@test bin]#mkdir terraform-test
    ```

6.  Enter the terraform-test directory.

    ```
    [root@test bin]#cd terraform-test
    [root@test terraform-test]#
    ```

7.  Create a configuration file. Terraform reads all \*.tf and \*.tfvars files in the directory when running. Therefore, you can write configuration information to different files as needed. Some common configuration files are described as follows:

    ```
    provider.tf: Used to configure providers.
    terraform.tfvars: Used to configure the variables required to configure providers.
    varable.tf: Used to configure universal variables.
    resource.tf: Used to define resources.
    data.tf: Used to define package files.
    output.tf: Used to configure the output.
    ```

    For example, when you create the provider.tf file, you can configure your authentication information as follows:

    ```
    [root@test terraform-test]# vim provider.tf
    provider "alicloud" {
        region           = "cn-beijing"
        access_key  = "LTA**********NO2"
        secret_key   = "MOk8x0*********************wwff"
    ```

    For more information about configurations, see [alicloud\_oss\_bucket](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/alicloud/r/oss_bucket.html).

8.  Initialize a working directory.

    ```
    [root@test terraform-test]#terraform init
    
    
    Initializing provider plugins...
    - Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...
    - Downloading plugin for provider "alicloud" (1.25.0)...
    
    
    
    
    The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
    so the latest version was installed.
    
    
    To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
    changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
    corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
    suggested below.
    
    
    * provider.alicloud: version = "~> 1.25"
    
    
    Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    
    
    You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
    any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
    should now work.
    
    
    If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
    rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
    commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
    
    
    ```

    **Note:** After creating a directory and configuration files for a Terraform project, you must initialize the directory.


You can use Terraform after completing the preceding steps.

## Use Terraform to manage OSS {#section_gmt_2zs_zfb .section}

After Terraform is installed, you can run commands in Terraform to manage OSS. Some common commands are described as follows:

-   terraform plan: You can run this command to view the operations to be executed by a configuration file.

    For example, you add a configuration file named test.tf that is used to create a bucket as follows:

    ```
    [root@test terraform-test]#vim test.tf
    resource "alicloud_oss_bucket" "bucket-acl"{
      bucket = "figo-chen-2020"
      acl = "private"
    }
    ```

    In this case, you can run the terraform plan command to view the operations to be executed by test.tf.

    ```
    [root@test terraform-test]# terraform plan
    Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
    The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
    persisted to local or remote state storage.
    
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
    Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
      + create
    
    Terraform will perform the following actions:
    
      + alicloud_oss_bucket.bucket-acl
          id:                <computed>
          acl:               "private"
          bucket:            "figo-chen-2020"
          creation_date:     <computed>
          extranet_endpoint: <computed>
          intranet_endpoint: <computed>
          location:          <computed>
          logging_isenable:  "true"
          owner:             <computed>
          referer_config.#:  <computed>
          storage_class:     <computed>
    
    
    Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
    can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
    "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
    ```

-   terraform apply: You can run this command to execute a configuration file in the working directory.

    For example, if you want to create a bucket named figo-chen-2020, you must add a configuration file named test.tf that is used to create a bucket as follows:

    ```
    [root@test terraform-test]#vim test.tf
    resource "alicloud_oss_bucket" "bucket-acl"{
      bucket = "figo-chen-2020"
      acl = "private"
    }
    ```

    Run the terraform apply command to execute the configuration file as follows:

    ```
    [root@test terraform-test]#terraform  apply
    
    An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
    Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
      + create
    
    Terraform will perform the following actions:
    
      + alicloud_oss_bucket.bucket-acl
          id:                <computed>
          acl:               "private"
          bucket:            "figo-chen-2020"
          creation_date:     <computed>
          extranet_endpoint: <computed>
          intranet_endpoint: <computed>
          location:          <computed>
          logging_isenable:  "true"
          owner:             <computed>
          referer_config.#:  <computed>
          storage_class:     <computed>
    
    
    Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
    
    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
    
      Enter a value: yes
    
    alicloud_oss_bucket.bucket-acl: Creating...
      acl:               "" => "private"
      bucket:            "" => "figo-chen-2020"
      creation_date:     "" => "<computed>"
      extranet_endpoint: "" => "<computed>"
      intranet_endpoint: "" => "<computed>"
      location:          "" => "<computed>"
      logging_isenable:  "" => "true"
      owner:             "" => "<computed>"
      referer_config.#:  "" => "<computed>"
      storage_class:     "" => "<computed>"
    alicloud_oss_bucket.bucket-acl: Creation complete after 1s (ID: figo-chen-2020)
    
    Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    ```

    **Note:** After you have executed the configuration file, a new bucket is created if the figo-chen-2020 bucket does not exist. If the figo-chen-2020 bucket already exists and is an empty bucket created by Terraform, the bucket is deleted and a new bucket with the same name is created.

-   `terraform destroy`: You can run this command to delete an empty bucket created by Terraform.
-   terraform import: You can run this command to import a bucket that is not created by Terraform.

    First, create a configuration file named main.tf and add configurations to the file as follows:

    ```
    [root@test terraform-test]#vim main.tf
    resource "alicloud_oss_bucket" "bucket" { 
     # (resource arguments)
    }
    ```

    Then, run the following command to import an existing bucket:

    ```
    terraform import alicloud_oss_bucket.bucket bucketname
    ```
