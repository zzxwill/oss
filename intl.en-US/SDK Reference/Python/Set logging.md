# Set logging {#concept_32037_zh .concept}

You can enable access logs to record bucket access to log files, which are stored in a specified bucket.

The log file format is as follows:

`<TargetPrefix><SourceBucket>-YYYY-mm-DD-HH-MM-SS-UniqueString`

For more information about access log files, see [Set access logging](../../../../reseller.en-US/Developer Guide/Security management/Set access logging.md#).

## Enable access logging {#section_gms_3gn_kfb .section}

Run the following code to enable bucket access logging:

```language-python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import oss2
from oss2.models import BucketLogging

# It is highly risky to log on with AccessKey of an Alibaba Cloud account because the account has permissions on all the APIs in OSS. We recommend that you log on as a RAM user to access APIs or perform routine operations and maintenance. To create a RAM account, log on to https://ram.console.aliyun.com.
auth = oss2.Auth('<yourAccessKeyId>', '<yourAccessKeySecret>')
# This example uses endpoint China (Hangzhou). Specify the actual endpoint based on your requirements.
bucket = oss2.Bucket(auth, 'http://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com', '<yourBucketName>')

# Enable access logging. Store log files in the current bucket and set the log file storage directory to 'logging/'.
bucket.put_bucket_logging(BucketLogging(bucket.bucket_name, 'logging/'))

```

## View access logging configurations { .section}

Run the following code to view the access logging configurations for a bucket:

```language-python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import oss2

# It is highly risky to log on with AccessKey of an Alibaba Cloud account because the account has permissions on all the APIs in OSS. We recommend that you log on as a RAM user to access APIs or perform routine operations and maintenance. To create a RAM account, log on to https://ram.console.aliyun.com.
auth = oss2.Auth('<yourAccessKeyId>', '<yourAccessKeySecret>')
# This example uses endpoint China (Hangzhou). Specify the actual endpoint based on your requirements.
bucket = oss2.Bucket(auth, 'http://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com', '<yourBucketName>')

logging = bucket.get_bucket_logging()
print('TargetBucket={0}, TargetPrefix={1}'.format(logging.target_bucket, logging.target_prefix))

```

## Disable access logging { .section}

Run the following code to disable access logging for a bucket:

```language-python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import oss2

# It is highly risky to log on with AccessKey of an Alibaba Cloud account because the account has permissions on all the APIs in OSS. We recommend that you log on as a RAM user to access APIs or perform routine operations and maintenance. To create a RAM account, log on to https://ram.console.aliyun.com.
auth = oss2.Auth('<yourAccessKeyId>', '<yourAccessKeySecret>')
# This example uses endpoint China (Hangzhou). Specify the actual endpoint based on your requirements.
bucket = oss2.Bucket(auth, 'http://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com', '<yourBucketName>')

bucket.delete_bucket_logging()

```
